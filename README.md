## Project description
This is my first project aimed at practical learning of testing.
It consists in creating sample test cases for 2 tasks selected by me from the MrBuggy3 application version 1.2.0.146:
- registration form (task no. 1 of the MrBuggy3 application),
- AND logic gate (task no. 8 of the MrBuggy3 application)
The project is created in English, while the names of fields, buttons and messages from the application remain in Polish.

## About the app
The MrBuggy3 app is the next release of the MrBuggy app. It was created and made available for the needs
TestingCup - Championship in Software Testing in 2015. MrBuggy 3 consists of 24 tasks that can be tested separately.
The software was developed at 21CN Radosław Smilgin. The application's creators are Radosław Smilgin, Paweł Piaskowy, Norbert Prochacki.
 
## Documentation/Requirements
- **Task No. 1 - the registration form has the following description:**

"Find and report a defect in the standard application function for creating a user account in the application.
Fields marked with an asterisk are required. The First Name and Last Name fields can accept any character according to the customer's requirements.
Base on your knowledge of how such an application should function. Don't look for usability defects."


- **Task No. 8 - AND logic gate has the following description:**

"The AND logic gate returns one for Input 1 and Input 2 equal to 1, and returns zero for other combinations of zero and one for Input 1 and Input 2.
Verify that the AND logic gate is working properly."
We do not know any other requirements for the operation of the above elements.
